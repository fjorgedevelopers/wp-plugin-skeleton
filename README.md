# wp-plugin-skeleton

## Change your plugin_name
To avoid future conflicts, the first thing you should do, is change plugin_name wherever you find it to the name of your plugin.


## A note about wp-cron
Hooks to wp-cron need to be in the base php file, where all of the includes are. You'll want to put those in the Hooks Manager. Don't. Trust us on this one.

## Who, what, where and why?
#### Who
[fjorge](https://fjorgedigital.com/) is a custom development company.
#### What
This is a boilderplate (or template, skeleton, etc) to get started making a wordpress plugin
#### Where
Our office is in the historic Rand Tower in downtown Minneapolis.
#### Why
We have written custom wordpress plugins for clients, and this plugin skeleton was made to make that faster. Our team uses open source extensively, and being able to contribute to the community is very exciting for us. With this skeleton we envision other developers writing wordpress plugins without some of the hardships we faced getting started. Most importantly to us, was that we don't require you to open source your code too. Write something for yourself! Write something for a client! Write something incredible that we never imagined!

We hope this helps.
